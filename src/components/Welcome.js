          MuiTA (Material UI Theme Assistant) is a tool to help you quickly and
          intuitively create Material UI themes for your React projects!

          "How does it work?.."
        </Typography>
        <Typography style={{ fontFamily: "Roboto" }} paragraph>
          It's very simple! You just hit the refresh button (bottom right of
          your screen) and MuiTA will provide you with a new theme at random,
          including fonts (provided by Google Fonts), colors and an image. If
          you like certain elements of it, you can lock them in the settings
          menu and they will remain upon subsequent refreshes. You can narrow
          the random search parameters via the settings menu. When you are happy
          with everything, you can copy the code and paste it directly into your
          project. The images are provided by the{" "}

          API and even though they are royalty-free, they are meant as more of a
          guide.

        <Typography style={{ fontFamily: "Roboto" }} paragraph>
          Absolutely! For now, you can save (and of course load!) them to the
          storage built into your browser. In the future, there are plans to
          offer online storage/sharing of themes.

          Great! Please feel free to fork the repo on{" "}
          <Link href="https://github.com/fuerte-nerd/muita" target="_blank">
            GitHub
          </Link>{" "}
          and play with it! There is a lot more functionality that could be
          built into the app, but time is my enemy! ;)
