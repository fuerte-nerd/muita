# MuiTA | Material-UI Theme Assistant
## FAQs
### "What is MuiTA?"
MuiTA (Material-UI Theme Assistant) is a tool to help developers quickly and intuitively create Material UI themes for their React projects!

### "How does it work?"
It's very simple! You just hit the refresh button (bottom right of your screen) and MuiTA will provide you with a new theme at random, including fonts (provided by Google Fonts), colors and an image. If you like certain elements of it, you can lock them in the settings menu and they will remain upon subsequent refreshes. You can narrow the random search parameters via the settings menu. When you are happy with everything, you can copy the code and paste it directly into your project. The images are provided via the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) API and even though they are royalty-free, they are meant as more of a guide.

### "Can I save my theme?"
Absolutely! For now, you can save (and of course load!) them to the storage built into your browser. In the future, there are plans to offer online storage/sharing of themes.

### "I would like to help improve MuiTA"
Great! Please feel free to fork the repo on GitHub and play with it! There is a lot more functionality that could be built into the app, but time is my enemy! ;)

### "I would like to contact you"
If you would like to report a bug, donate to the project, help develop MuiTA, hire me, or get in touch with me for any other reason, my email address is [fuertenerd@gmail.com](mailto:fuertenerd@gmail.com).
